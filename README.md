# Eat the Burger
This is a application to track the burgers you have created this lets the user save, create, remove, and update burgers in the database.  This works by using html, css, and javascript for the front end of the application. The back end works by storing all the users burger information in a SQL database schema set up for everything you wish to do on the front end of the app. Enjoy!
